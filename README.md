Comparative analysis and runnable examples of authentication mechanisms used in Azure workloads and CI/CD pipelines.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository provides:
- Clear architectural comparison
- Minimal runnable examples
- Security-focused guidance
- Practical CI/CD integration patterns

📌 Overview
This repository demonstrates and explains the most common authentication models used in Azure:
    • System-Assigned Managed Identity (SAMI)
    • User-Assigned Managed Identity (UAMI)
    • Service Principal with Client Secret
    • Service Principal with Certificate
    • Service Principal with OIDC Federation (GitHub Actions)
The goal is to clarify:
    • When each model should be used
    • How authentication flows work
    • Security implications
    • Token acquisition mechanisms
    • RBAC integration patterns


🧠 1️⃣ System-Assigned Managed Identity (SAMI)
When to use
    • Workloads running inside Azure
    • VM scripts
    • Azure Functions
    • App Services
    • Internal service-to-service communication
Key Characteristics
    • Identity tied to a single Azure resource
    • No credential management
    • Token retrieved from IMDS endpoint
    • Automatically deleted with the resource
Authentication Flow

    A -->|Request Token| B
    B -->|OAuth2| C
    C -->|Access Token| A
    A -->|Bearer Token| D


🧠 2️⃣ User-Assigned Managed Identity (UAMI)
When to use
    • Multiple Azure resources share same identity
    • Separation of compute and identity lifecycle
    • Controlled identity reuse
Key Characteristics
    • Identity independent from resource
    • Can be attached to multiple VMs
    • Can be explicitly selected via client_id
    • Requires RBAC assignment

🧠 3️⃣ Service Principal + Client Secret
When to use
    • External applications
    • Legacy CI/CD
    • Non-OIDC compatible systems
Key Characteristics
    • Requires secret management
    • Secret expiration and rotation required
    • Uses OAuth2 Client Credentials Flow

    C -->|Access Token| A
    A --> D

🧠 4️⃣ Service Principal + OIDC Federation (Modern CI/CD)
When to use
    • GitHub Actions
    • Azure DevOps (OIDC)
    • External CI/CD platforms supporting OpenID Connect
Key Characteristics
    • No stored secrets
    • Token exchange model
    • Federated identity configuration
    • Short-lived tokens
    • Recommended modern pattern

📊 Comparison Table
Feature	SAMI	UAMI	SP + Secret	SP + OIDC
Runs inside Azure only	✔	✔	❌	❌
Requires secret	❌	❌	✔	❌
Credential rotation	❌	❌	✔	❌
Reusable across resources	❌	✔	✔	✔
Recommended for CI/CD	❌	❌	⚠️ Legacy	✔
Security level	High	High	Medium	Very High

🔎 Token Acquisition Method
Model	Token Source
Managed Identity	IMDS endpoint
Service Principal	Azure AD OAuth2
OIDC	Federated token exchange

🛡 Security Considerations
Managed Identity
    • Best for Azure-hosted workloads
    • Eliminates secret exposure
    • Minimal attack surface
Service Principal + Secret
    • Secret leakage risk
    • Requires rotation policy
    • Avoid when OIDC available
OIDC Federation
    • No static credentials
    • Strong identity binding
    • Short-lived tokens
    • Modern best practice


🎯 Best Practice Recommendations
Scenario	Recommended Model
Azure VM automation	Managed Identity
Shared identity across services	User-Assigned MI
GitHub → Azure deployment	OIDC Federation
Legacy system	Service Principal + Certificate

📚 Practical Examples
This repository may include:
    • VM script using Managed Identity
    • GitHub workflow using OIDC
    • Example of SP with client secret
    • RBAC assignment examples
See `examples/README.md` for runnable demos.

🧠 Key Insight
Managed Identity is technically a Service Principal.
The difference is lifecycle and credential management are handled automatically by Azure.
OIDC is also based on a Service Principal — but uses token federation instead of static credentials.
